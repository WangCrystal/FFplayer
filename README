any question, feel free to contact me<philip584521@gmail.com>

some configuration steps need to executed before building:
1> create a "NDK_Builder" for this project in Eclipse to build the native code automatically
	In the main tab
	Location: /bin/bash
	Working Directory:The directory in which your project source is saved.
	Arguments:
	--login -c "source  /etc/profile && cd /work/Project_Windows/FFPlayer &&ndk-build V=1"

	be sure your have added the directory which contain the ndk-build script<download it from http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html> into your PATH environment variable
