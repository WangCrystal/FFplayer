This is a third-party media player which developed basing on the ffmpeg native code to support the playback of local/HLS streaming on Android devices

Any question, feel free to contact me<philip584521@gmail.com>

Some configuration steps need to executed before building when using master brance:
1> create a "NDK_Builder" for this project in Eclipse to build the native code automatically
    In the main tab
    Location: /bin/bash
    Working Directory:The directory in which your project source is saved.
    Arguments:
    --login -c "source  /etc/profile && cd /work/Project_Windows/FFPlayer &&ndk-build V=1"

    be sure your have added the directory which contain the ndk-build script<download it from http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html> into your PATH environment variable

For faywong/dev branch, you just need to config the ndk-plugin in the latest eclipse & adt environment, it's hardy.
